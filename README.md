<h1>WorkSpot</h1>

WorkSpot is a web application that provides a platform for finding and posting short-term jobs or tasks, such as shoveling driveways or walking a neighbor's dog. It was created with the intention of helping students and other individuals earn extra money on the side, without the need for a long-term or part-time job commitment.

The idea for WorkSpot first came about when I was in high school and university, and was looking for ways to earn extra income. I realized that there were a lot of people in my community who needed small tasks done, and that this presented an opportunity to connect those in need with those who could complete these tasks.
