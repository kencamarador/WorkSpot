<h1>WorkSpot</h1>

WorkSpot was a university idea I alway's thought about creating and now it's come to life. When I was in High School and University, I wanted to earn some money on the side and I thought about the idea of having a marketplace for jobs. I wasn't thinking just ordinary jobs but even small tasks, such as shovelling driveways or walking your neighbour's dog. I figured that this was a solution to help the youth earn money in their pockets with out commiting to a full time or part time job. Need a task done? Well, you can post your task on WorkSpot to reach out to others. With WorkSpot, you are able to create, view, update and delete your postings. Find a task today!
